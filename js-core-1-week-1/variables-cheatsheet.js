// Syntax
const food; // <-- need to declare and assign this constant a value
let drinks; // <-- this works

const 2Slow = "This isn't fast at all" // <-- you can't start with a number, cause syntax error
const tooSlow = "This isn't fast at all" // <-- this works

// Styling

// Camel Case
const vans = 7
const personWeight = 88
const firstName = 'Amy'

// Capital Case
const Vans = 7
const PersonWeight = 88
const FirstName = 'Amy'

// Snake Case
const VAN = 7
const PERSON_WEIGHT = 88
const FIRST_NAME = 'Amy'


// How to name
// noun
// adjective + noun
// In JavaScript land we keep variables or constant names small

// Naming a variable or constant should be based on "Context"

const personsDistanceThisFarFromTheStation = 420 // <-- context is good, but this is too long
const distance = 420 // <-- better, though it's harder to understand the context
const distanceAway = 420 // <-- this gives us enough context and is of correct length
