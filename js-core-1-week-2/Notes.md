# Wrap Up

##Â Boolean Analogy
Booleans data types are like light switches

- Light switches can either be on or off
- i.e. true or false (on or off)
- You can't have the state of the light being on and off at the same time

## Conditionals

- Needs to be given a value that **evaluates** to either **true** or **false**
- evaluates true **it executes** the code within its coding block
- evaluates false **it does not execute** the code within its coding block
